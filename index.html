    <section class="quotes">
        <p>Live Like Jake has been a true blessing to our family. With their assistance, I was able to obtain swim rescue lessons for all three of my children that we could not afford otherwise. With a backyard pool, water safety has always been a major concern, but most safety measures seemed so out of reach with a limited income. We are forever grateful for the gift she has given my children!</p>
