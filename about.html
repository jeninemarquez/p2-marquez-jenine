<!-- Jake's Story -->
<section id="jakes-story">
<img src="images/me-and-jake.jpg" alt="Jake and his mom">
    <p>Every child is special and Jake was no exception. He almost always had a smile on his face, especially when he met people. He understood humor and had the ability to create his own happiness from all the good and wonderful things this life has to offer. He loved the simple things like lights, fans, frogs, spiders, lizards, shapes, the moon and his favorite thing, pushing his baby stroller around.</p>
    <p>On November 30, 2013, while visiting family in New Smyrna Beach, the Morrison’s lives as they knew them changed forever. At approximately 6:00 pm the words “Where is Jake” were screamed out and the frantic search for their precious son began. It was pitch dark outside and knowing that their son had fallen off the dock into the Intracoastal and they couldn’t save him will forever haunt them. After about 20 minutes of screaming and searching for Jake he was found and taken by ambulance immediately to the hospital where they were not able to revive him.</p>
    <p>Not a day goes by that the Morrison’s don’t miss their little boy. But through the pain and tears they have made it their mission to keep Jake’s joyous spirit alive. As a result, the Morrison’s established the Live Like Jake Foundation to provide awareness for drowning prevention and SAVE LIVES.</p>
    <p>What does it mean to Live Like Jake? Many people can remember how it was to be a child, full of life, fascinated with nature and the world around them…For the Morrison’s to “Live Like Jake” means living with no prejudgments, needing very little to be happy, not getting bogged down with petty things or inconsequential circumstances. Also, for us it means to try and be a positive spark to people we meet and to greet everyone with a smile. You never get over losing a child; you only are only able to get through it and the only way to get through it is by faith. In honor of Jake, the Morrison’s try their best to keep a smile on their face, laugh when they can, and do their best to live everyday like their son Jake would have!</p>
