<!-- Statistics -->
<section id="statistics">
    <p>Each year, about 4,000 people drown in the United States; drowning kills more children 1-4 years of age than anything else except birth defects. Among children 1-14, drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional injury death (after motor vehicle crashes). More than half of those who are treated in an emergency department for drowning require hospitalization or transfer for further care (compared with about 6% of all unintentional injuries). A person who survives drowning may suffer lasting consequences like brain damage. </p>

 <h2>About ISR</h2>
    <p>Founded in 1966 by Dr. Harvey Barnett, Infant Swimming Resource, or ISR, is now the global leader in the industry it pioneered: survival swimming lessons for infants and young children. Infant Swimming Survival Lessons combined with pool fences, supervision, and pool alarms are important parts of a necessary multi-layered approach to drowning prevention. However, traditional lines of defense break down, and the over 4,000 drowning deaths per year bear a grim testament to the fact that traditional approaches are missing a key component: the child. ISR’s core conviction is that the child is the most important part of a drowning prevention strategy and our over 260,000 ISR graduates and 800 documented survival stories are proof that children can save themselves. Children are curious, capable, and have an uncanny ability to overcome obstacles like pool fences; at ISR we take that ability and teach them skills to potentially save themselves if they find themselves in the water alone.</p>

<!-- Safety Tips -->
<section id="safety-tips">
    <i class="fa fa-binoculars"></i>
    <h2>Effective Supervision</h2>
    <p>The most critical line of defense is adult supervision. No level of aquatic skill can replace active supervision. If your child is ever missing, look in the water first.</p>

    <i class="fa fa-lock"></i>
    <h2>Pool Fences</h2>
    <p>Install a permanent 4-sided fence with self-locking gates. Ensure that the pool fence is at least 3-5 feet from the pool edge.</p>
   
    <i class="fa fa-bell"></i>
    <h2>Alarms</h2>
    <p>Make sure all doors and windows leading to the pool are locked and alarmed.</p>
    
    <i class='	fa fa-life-ring'></i>
    <h2>Survival Swimming Lessons</h2>
    <p>A moment’s inattention does not have to cost a child his life. ISR’s Self-Rescue® training is an added layer of protection, teaching your child water survival skills in a completely safe environment.</p>

    <i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i>
    <h2>CPR</h2>
    <p>If an emergency happens, it is essential parents and families are prepared. Learn to perform CPR on children and adults and remember to update those skills regularly.</p>
